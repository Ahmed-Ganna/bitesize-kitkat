# Android KitKat: finger-by-finger 


## Introduction

Before KitKat it has been possible to build fully-featured SMS apps on Android,
but it has involved using hidden APIs - somewhat less than ideal. In KitKat
Android opens up these APIs to allow developers to create apps which replace
the default SMS app - in the same way the Google Hangouts can.

In this week's article we'll take a look at what you need to do to be able to
create your own SMS app on KitKat, but first we'll have a look at how you can
receive SMS messages without taking the responsibility of being the default SMS
app on the device.

The code for the app which accompanies this article is available on Github at
GITHUB_LINK_HERE. It was developed in Android Studio 0.4.4 and therefore is a
gradle project. Any problems then feel free to give me a shout or create a pull
request to fix it :)
